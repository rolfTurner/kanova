04/March/2021

Initial instance of package.
Version 0.0-1.

04/March/2021

Amended the code to allow the permutations to be effected by
permuting residuals in the case of one-way anova and that of testing
for a main effect, as well as testing for an interaction
Introduced a new argument "permtype" specifying which sort
of permutation (residuals or data) should be used.

Added a vignette providing mathematical expressions for the
test statistics used.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-2.

Made a slight tweak to the vignette.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-3.

09/March/2021
Corrected a stupid error that I had made in calculating the residuals
to be permuted.  These must be residuals from null model and I was
calculating residuals from the full model.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-4.

15/March/2021
Amended the code to accept as input ("datObj") a list of numeric vectors
to be interpreted as K-functions.  Note that in this case "datObj" must
have an attribute "r" serving as the argument of these K-functions.

Note that these putative K-functions may actually be *scalars* (which
allows "ordinary" analysis of variance to be conducted).  In this case
the "r" attribute must also be a scalar (and is arbitrary).

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-5.

21/March/2021
Added a new version of kanova() (kanova2()) with a substantially
altered data structure and procedure for effecting the permutations.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-6.

20/February/2023
Replace kanova() by kanova2().

Substantially revised and debugged.  Corrected the (essentially backwards)
indexing of the data.

Added an argument "studentize", defaulting to TRUE, permitting the
user to *NOT* studentize the test statistic.  This argument was
added basically to permit the comparison of the test statistic with
one that can be computed in a simple-minded manner in the case of
scalar "K functions".

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-7.

26/February/2023
Adjusted kanova() to use a formula argument.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-8.

27/February/2023
Copied kanova.R to kanovaDB.R (making kanovaDB() an internal
function) and got rid of the studentize argument from kanova().
WTF does "DB" mean?  Said he on 15/May/2023.  Perhaps "debug"?

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-9.

15/May/2023

Started adjusting the residuals to be "standardised" residuals, in
the hope that this may enhance exchangeability when the permutation
test is conducted by means of permuting the residuals.

05/June/2023
Realised that I need to get my head together on the resulting Studentisation
variance.  Re-wrote the vignette testStat.ltx.

05/July/2023
Extensive revision of the kanova function completed.  It is now
assumed that under the null hypothesis (of no group effect[s]) the
variance of the K-function associated with a pattern X is equal to
sigma^2/m where m is the number of points in X.  The calculation
of the test statistic becomes thereby much cleaner and to some
extent simpler.  Estimates of K-functions are now calculated as
weighted means of individual K-functions, with the weights being
the numbers of points in the associated patterns. See the vignette
"testStat" for more discussion.

Eliminated the auxiliary functions kanovaEngine(), permDatMat()
and statPrep().  Added auxiliary functions permSumFns(), resAndFit(),
testStat(), and wtdMeans().

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-10.

05/July/2023
Revised initPrep() so that, if desired, the names of the levels of
the classification factors can be "simplified".  This is effected
by giving kanova() a new argument "simpNms".

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-11.

25/04/2024
Modified kanova() so that if "fmla" involves a variable not found
in "data" then that variable is looked for in parent.frame().  If
it is still not found, then an error (with an appropriate message)
is thrown.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.0-12.

01/05/2024
Modified the structure so that the data must *alway* be a hyperframe.
The response column of this hyperframe is now allowed to be a list of
numeric vectors (the ostensible summary functions of point patterns),
and not just a list of point patterns.  Made numerous adjustments
to kanova.R and initPrep.R.  Got rid of the "simNms" and "iperm"
arguments to kanova().  Added a "brief=TRUE" argument to kanova();
if "brief" is FALSE, then a more elaborate object is returned.
Added an "EffectName" component to the list being returned.
Made "Tstar" a component of the list being returned, when "brief"
is FALSE (rather than an attribute created when "keepsimstats"
is TRUE (and got rid of the argument "keepsimstats").

Added examples to the kanova help file, illustrating the scenario
in which the response is a list of numeric vectors.  Also an example
in which these numeric vectors are actually scalars.  (Example taken
from the Devore7 package; the DESCRIPTION file now suggests Devore7.)

Substantial change, so incremented the minor version number.

05/05/2024
Corrected a typo (Pseudi |--> Pseudo) in the DESCRIPTION file.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.1-1.

17/05/2024
Corrected major (conceptual!) bug w.r.t. creation of the mean summary
functions and the studentising variances. Revised the way these means
and variances are stored --- put them into "data", where they should
have been put all along!

05/06/2024

The foregoing "Revised the way ..." is not actually correct. The mean summary
functions and the studentisation have however been corrected.

Fixed various bugs/glitches in testStat().

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.1-3.

30/06/2024

Revised builds2Khat(), fixing various (major!) glitches.
Introduced the logical argument do.s2; if this is FALSE, s2
does not get calculated.  Discontinued use of wtdMeans() --- which
wasn't being used correctly --- and replaced calls to wtdMeans()
with calls to builds2Khat(...,do.s2=FALSE)

Fixed a bug in resAndFit() (when "type" was equal to "interac",
tried to extract Khat from iDat; no such component any longer;
never should have been there).

04/07/2024

Fixed same bug (!!!) when type was equal to "oneway".

Revised the "testStat" vignette a bit.

19/07/2024
`
Further fiddling with the vignette.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.1-4.

21/07/2024

Changed email address to my posteo address, in the DESCRIPTION
file.  Changed "anova" to "Anova" in the title (should be in
title case).  Wrapped a bit of the kanova() examples in \dontrun{}
to reduce the time a bit.  (Winbuilder said the toadal time was
12.14 > 10.00 seconds.  I get only 8.927 seconds in my timing
calculations. (???) Irrespective of that,  I cut a bit out.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.1-5.

25/07/2024

Further tweaks to the vignette.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.1-6.

03/08/2024
Adjusted the vignette structure so that the package would build
under rhub, by using the "asis" concept from the R.rsp package.
The vignette directory now holds vignetteForTestStat.pdf and
vignetteForTestStat.pdf.asis.

Created a directory preVignettes, parellel with vignettes, to
hold the components (kanova.bib, testStat.ltx) from which the file
vignetteForTestStat.pdf, in the vignettes directory, can be built.

Incremented the version number.
Version 0.1-7.

12/08/2024
Added the function ripVar() to calculate the variance of the
K-function of a Poisson process.  (Was intending to make use of
this function in calculating the test statistics, but since the
procedure is only valid for Poisson processes I decided that this
was pointless.)

13/08/2024
Added the arguments "expo" and "rsteps" to kanova() and to
initPrep().

Adjusted the initPrep() code so that the length of the "r" argument
to the summary function is rsteps+1 (where rsteps defaults to 128).
Rather than (in the case of Kest()) being hard-wired to 513.
Adjusted the code so that the "r" argument consists of values on the
interval [0,rtop] where rtop is calculated by rmax.rule().  So the
code now works for all four summary functions, not just for Kest().

Edited the vignette to reflect the current state of affairs.

Added some remarks on fitted values and residuals (mainly via
reference to the vignette) to the help for kanova().  Incremented the
version number.  Version 0.1-8.
